# ⚠️ Wind Turbine Damage Conditions

This document outlines the key environmental and mechanical conditions that can lead to wind turbine damage. Understanding these failure modes is essential for designing robust simulations and predictive maintenance strategies.

## 🌪️ 1. Blade Damage
- **Causes**: Fatigue, hail impact, UV degradation, lightning strikes
- **Effects**: Reduced efficiency, vibration, structural failure

## ⚙️ 2. Gearbox Failure
- **Causes**: High torque loads, lubricant breakdown, misalignment
- **Effects**: Downtime, costly repairs, power loss

## 🔩 3. Bearing Failure
- **Causes**: Vibration, poor lubrication, contamination
- **Effects**: Rotor instability, increased wear

## 🛑 4. Brake System Failure
- **Causes**: Overheating, wear, poor maintenance
- **Effects**: Overspeed risk, safety hazard

## ⚡ 5. Electrical Failures
- **Causes**: Voltage spikes, insulation breakdown, corrosion
- **Effects**: Generator shutdown, grid instability

## 🏗️ 6. Structural Failures
- **Causes**: Tower fatigue, foundation settling, extreme loads
- **Effects**: Cracking, collapse, reconstruction

## 🌊 7. Environmental Factors
- **Causes**: Salt spray, humidity, extreme temperatures
- **Effects**: Accelerated corrosion, material degradation
