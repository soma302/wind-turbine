# 🌬️ Wind Turbine Simulation Model

This repository contains a dynamic simulation of a horizontal-axis wind turbine, built in Python. It models aerodynamic power extraction, mechanical drive train dynamics, and basic control strategies.

## 📌 Features

- Calculates power output based on wind speed and rotor parameters
- Modular structure for aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical subsystems
- Visualization of power output vs wind speed
- Expandable to include pitch/yaw control and grid interface

## 📚 Literature References

This project is grounded in the following key resources:

## 🧠 Model Overview

The simulation includes:

- **Aerodynamic Model**: Based on Betz’s law and Cp curves
- **Mechanical Model**: Rotor inertia, shaft stiffness, damping
- **Generator Model**: Simplified induction generator
- **Control System**: Basic pitch and torque control logic
